# Understanding package.json

## What is package.json?

The `package.json` file is a manifest file for a Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and more. This file is essential for managing the project's dependencies and settings.

## Key Fields in package.json

- **name**: The name of the project.
- **version**: The version of the project.
- **description**: A brief description of the project.
- **main**: The entry point file for the project.
- **scripts**: A set of commands that can be run using `npm run`.
- **dependencies**: Packages required by the project.
- **devDependencies**: Packages required for development but not in production.
- **repository**: Information about the repository hosting the project.
- **author**: Information about the author of the project.
- **license**: The license under which the project is released.
