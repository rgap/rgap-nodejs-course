# npm install

## What does npm install do?

The `npm install` command installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads the necessary packages from the npm registry to the `node_modules` directory in the project.

## Usage

```sh
npm install
```

## How it works

1. Reads the `package.json` file.
2. Resolves the versions of dependencies.
3. Downloads the dependencies from the npm registry.
4. Installs the dependencies into the `node_modules` directory.

## Benefits

- Ensures that all required packages are installed.
- Automatically handles dependency resolution.
- Creates a `package-lock.json` file to lock the versions of installed packages.
