## The process object

The `process` object is a **global** object in Node.js that provides comprehensive information and control over the currently executing Node.js process. It allows access to:

- Environment variables
- CPU architecture
- Platform-specific behavior
- Process arguments
- Uptime, memory, and other runtime metrics

## âœ… When to Use These Properties

- Debugging platform-specific bugs
- Logging system information
- Conditional logic in CLI tools or installers
- Avoiding compatibility issues in cross-platform apps
