/**
 * 🗂️ Simulated Backup Script
 *
 * This script represents a task that might be triggered by `execFile()`
 * from another part of your Node.js app or from a DevOps script.
 *
 * ✅ Use Cases:
 *   - Creating backups of a database
 *   - Zipping and copying a folder
 *   - Exporting data from an API
 *
 * In production, this might use:
 *   - `fs` module to copy files
 *   - `archiver` to zip directories
 *   - Shell commands via `spawn` to call tools like `pg_dump`, `tar`, etc.
