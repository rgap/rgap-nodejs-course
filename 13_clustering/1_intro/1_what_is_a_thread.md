# 🧵 What is a Thread?

In computer science, a **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. It represents a single flow of control and is used to perform tasks concurrently within an application.

## 📌 Characteristics of a Thread

| Feature              | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Lives inside         | A process                                        |
| Shares memory        | Yes, with other threads in the same process      |
| Lightweight          | Compared to a full process                       |
| Can run concurrently | Yes, multiple threads can run in parallel        |
| Scheduling           | Done by the operating system or language runtime |

## 🧠 Why Threads Matter

- Threads enable **concurrent execution**, improving performance on multi-core CPUs.
- Useful for tasks like:
  - I/O operations (file reads, network calls)
  - Background computation (image processing, data crunching)

In multi-threaded applications (e.g., Java, C++), developers often use threads to keep the UI responsive or perform multiple jobs in parallel.

## 📘 Node.js Context

Node.js is **single-threaded** from the JavaScript perspective, meaning:

- Only one thread runs the main event loop (your code).
- But! Node.js uses a **thread pool** behind the scenes via [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) to offload heavy or blocking tasks like:
  - File I/O
  - DNS resolution
  - Compression
  - Network operations

So while you don’t create threads directly in JavaScript, they’re still crucial to Node's performance.

## 🍽️ Analogy

Imagine a restaurant:

- The main chef takes all the orders (main thread).
- Helpers in the kitchen (worker threads) do the actual cooking, dishwashing, etc.
- The chef never waits — this keeps the whole restaurant efficient.

## ✅ Summary

- Threads are essential for doing multiple things at once.
- JavaScript in Node.js doesn’t use them directly, but Node still benefits via the libuv thread pool.
- Understanding threads helps explain Node.js performance and its limitations.
