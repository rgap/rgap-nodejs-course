# üåÄ Node Version Manager (nvm)

## üìú What is `nvm`?

`nvm` (Node Version Manager) is a command-line tool that lets you **install**, **manage**, and **switch** between different versions of Node.js on your system.

> It works by manipulating environment variables and shell initialization files, allowing projects to be pinned to specific versions of Node.js.

## üß† Why Use `nvm`?

| Problem Without `nvm`                      | What `nvm` Solves                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| You install Node.js globally via a package | Different projects require different versions |
| System-wide updates break older projects   | You can isolate versions per project          |
| CI/CD pipelines fail on version mismatch   | You can replicate specific versions easily    |

---

## ‚è≥ Historical Context

- **Released in 2011** as a way to manage Node.js versions locally without needing root access.
- It became especially popular after npm and Node.js started evolving independently, leading to version conflicts.
- Alternatives emerged later (`n`, `asdf`, `volta`), but `nvm` remains the most widely used for _shell-based workflows_.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Install and switch between any Node.js version
- Use `.nvmrc` files to pin project-specific versions
- No root access required
- Works on Linux, macOS, WSL

---

## üö´ Limitations

- **Does not work on Windows natively** (use `nvm-windows` instead)
- Shell-specific: works best with `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`
- Requires restarting the shell or sourcing `.nvm/nvm.sh`

---

## üí° When to Use

- You work on multiple projects using **different versions of Node.js**
- You want **easy upgrades/downgrades** of Node
- You're using **CI environments** that rely on version switching
