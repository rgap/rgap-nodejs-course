# üß≠ Logging Best Practices

## üéØ Goal

Understand **how to log effectively** ‚Äî not just how to use logging tools. Proper logging is critical for debugging, auditing, and maintaining healthy production systems.

## ‚úÖ General Best Practices

| Practice                         | Why It Matters                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Log with context                 | Include request IDs, user IDs, IPs when relevant               |
| Include timestamps               | Always timestamp logs (manual or via logger)                   |
| Use levels consistently          | Don‚Äôt misuse `info` for errors or `error` for normal flow      |
| Avoid logging sensitive data     | Redact tokens, passwords, personal info                        |
| Don‚Äôt rely only on `console.log` | Use structured loggers in real apps                            |
| Rotate log files                 | Prevent logs from growing indefinitely                         |
| Store logs persistently          | Use file logging or external systems (e.g., ELK, Sentry)       |
| Capture unhandled errors         | Use `process.on('unhandledRejection')` and `uncaughtException` |
| Flush logs before exit           | Especially important when using async logging libraries        |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Avoid

- ‚ùå Logging secrets like passwords, tokens, or credit card data
- ‚ùå Logging too much (log spam = slower performance)
- ‚ùå Swallowing errors without logging them
- ‚ùå Only logging in development environments

---

## üß∞ Production Tips

- Use a library like `winston` or `pino`
- Pipe logs to monitoring tools (e.g. Datadog, Logstash, Papertrail)
- Separate logs by category: `app`, `db`, `auth`, etc.
- Format logs in JSON if integrating with external systems

## ‚úÖ Summary

Good logging turns confusing bugs into solvable problems. It‚Äôs **not just about writing to the console**, but about capturing meaningful, readable, and relevant information for the right people ‚Äî at the right time.
