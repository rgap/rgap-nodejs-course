# ðŸ§° What is Virtualization?

**Virtualization** means simulating hardware or software so that multiple systems can run on a single physical computer.

## Example

- You run Windows on your laptop, but you can also install Ubuntu using **VirtualBox** or **VMware** â€” thatâ€™s virtualization.

## Benefits

- Use different operating systems at once
- Simulate a full computer (CPU, RAM, storage)

> Virtualization is how we used to deploy apps in isolated environments before containers.
