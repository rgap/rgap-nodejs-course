# üê≥ Dockerfile for MongoDB container
# We are simply using the official mongo image, but wrapped in our own Dockerfile for learning purposes.

# Step 1: Use official MongoDB image as the base
FROM mongo:7

# Step 2: Expose MongoDB default port
EXPOSE 27017

# Step 3: Optional entrypoint (not required, mongo starts by default)
CMD ["mongod"]

# üí° Notes:
# - This Dockerfile doesn't add any custom files.
# - Useful for learning how to build a container from a base image.
