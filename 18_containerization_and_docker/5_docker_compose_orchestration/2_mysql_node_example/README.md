## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command builds and starts:

- A Node.js app (Express)
- A MySQL service
- Both connected in an isolated network

---

## ðŸ§¼ Tear It Down

```bash
docker compose down
```

This will stop and remove all the containers from the `docker-compose.yml`.
