# 🧩 Introduction to Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool introduced in **2014** by Docker Inc. to simplify the process of defining and managing multi-container applications. It uses a single file (`docker-compose.yml`) to describe an application's services, networks, and volumes, allowing you to run everything with one command.

---

## 📜 Historical Context

Before Compose, running multiple containers required executing separate `docker run` commands and manually linking them via networks and environment variables. As microservice architectures grew more popular, this became error-prone and hard to maintain.

Docker Compose was born from the open-source project **Fig**, which Docker later acquired and transformed into `docker-compose`.

## ⚙️ Why Use Docker Compose?

- 🧠 **Declarative Configuration**: All container settings in one file
- 🪄 **Simple Commands**: Start or stop the whole app with `up` or `down`
- 🔗 **Service Networking**: Services can discover each other by name
- 🧪 **Dev/Test Environments**: Ideal for local development and CI
