# Introduction to REST

## What is REST?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP. RESTful systems are characterized by being resource-based, using standard HTTP methods, and having a uniform interface.

## Key Principles of REST

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: This principle enforces the separation of concerns. The client and server are independent of each other, which allows them to evolve separately.
2. **Statelessness**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any session state between requests.
3. **Cacheability**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale data. This can significantly improve performance and scalability.
4. **Layered System**: The architecture can be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior. Each layer does not know or care about the layers beyond the next.
5. **Code on Demand (optional)**: Servers can temporarily extend or customize client functionality by transferring executable code. This is optional and less frequently used.
6. **Uniform Interface**: Simplifies and decouples the architecture, allowing each part to evolve independently. It is the key feature that distinguishes REST from other architectural styles.

## Benefits of REST

- **Scalability**: RESTful APIs can handle a large number of requests by distributing the load across multiple servers.
- **Flexibility**: The statelessness and uniform interface allow for independent evolution of client and server.
- **Performance**: Caching can improve the performance by reducing the server load and latency.
- **Interoperability**: RESTful APIs use standard protocols and data formats, making it easy for different systems to interact.

## History of REST

REST was introduced and defined by Roy Fielding in his 2000 PhD dissertation. It was designed to guide the development of the modern web and to create a more efficient, scalable, and easy-to-use architecture. REST has since become a dominant architectural style for web services.

### Code Example

This example sets up a basic Express server that responds to a GET request.

**server.js**:

```javascript
const express = require("express"); // Import the express module

// Create an instance of Express
const app = express();
const port = 8080;

// Define a route to handle GET requests
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!"); // Send the response body "Hello, World!"
});

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});

/**
 * This basic example demonstrates the following concepts:
 * - Creating an Express application
 * - Defining a route to handle GET requests
 * - Sending a simple text response
 * - Starting the server and listening on a specific port
 *
 * Historical Context:
 * - REST was defined by Roy Fielding in his 2000 PhD dissertation.
 * - It aims to create a more efficient, scalable, and easy-to-use web.
 * - Express simplifies creating RESTful APIs by providing a robust routing mechanism.
