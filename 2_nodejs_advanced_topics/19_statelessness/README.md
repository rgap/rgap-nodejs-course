# Statelessness in REST

## What is Statelessness?

Statelessness is a constraint of the REST architecture that requires each request from a client to the server to contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any context or session data between requests.

## Benefits of Statelessness

- **Scalability**: Statelessness allows servers to handle more requests by not storing session data, making it easier to distribute requests across multiple servers.
- **Reliability**: Each request is independent, reducing the chance of errors caused by previous requests.
- **Simplified Server Design**: Servers do not need to manage session data, simplifying their design and implementation.

## Implications of Statelessness

- **Client Responsibility**: Clients must send all necessary information with each request, including authentication credentials.
- **Cacheability**: Responses can be cached, as they do not depend on any stored server state.
- **Visibility**: Each request is self-contained, making it easier to monitor and debug.

## Example of Stateless Request

### Request 1: Fetch User Data

```http
GET /users/1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Request 2: Update User Data

```http
PUT /users/1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
"name": "Updated User"
}
```

In both requests, the client sends all necessary information, including the user ID and authentication token, allowing the server to process each request independently.
